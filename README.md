# Magellanic_Clouds_microlensing

The codes simulate Large and Small Magellanic clouds and potential microlensing events toward them due to free-floating planets in the Galactic halos.  
In these codes, synthetic data points taken by the Roman telescope are generated.

'sigma_WFIRST.txt' contains the Roman detection efficiency versus the Einstein crossing time, as kindly shared by S. Johnson.  

'convert_coordinate.dat' files determine the relation between Galactic and celestial coordinates, that are read in the codes.  

If you want to run the codes on your own computer, you should have some files containing the photometry properties of stars (that are read by codes).  I will share them if you need them.  In that case 
please contact me: sedighe.sajadian@gmail.com 

Any use of these codes should acknowledge by citing the following paper:
